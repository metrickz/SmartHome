# Background
- Machines still rely on mental abilities of their user
- Machines become more and more complex
- Yet their operation should be easy
- We live in the age of Internet of Things and Industry 4.0
- The internet is more than just visiting websites & chatting
- Smart home systems offer security and protect the environment


# Aim
Development of a hybridised Human-Machine-Interface in a Smart-Home environment
- Easy to use
- Transparent
- Central & Remote controllable
- Control digital and analogue devices
- Cost-effective
- Internet connected

# Planning
- Host computer is central element
- Android Application
- Arduino as microcontroller
- TCP connection for communication between phone and host
- Serial connection between host and microcontroller

# The host computer
- Programmed in C++ with QT Framework
- Is the central Human-Machine-Interface
- Forwards instructions from app to the controller
- Receives weather data from the internet

# The mobile application
- Programmed in Java with Android Studio
- Bidirectional connection
- Remote control the microcontroller
- User Interface is synchronised
with the host

# The controller
- Programmed in C / C++ like language
- Main controller is Arduino Mega
- Main controller fetches sensor data and controls actuators
- AC-Controllers are Arduinos as well
- AC-Controllers are necessary for dimmable actuators

# Results
- System is able to control actuators from local panel or remotely via mobile application
- Reliable communication between the components
- Sensors can be read and actuators can be controlled
- Cost effective

# Conclusions
- Unlike other systems, this system can be reproduced by other engineers
- Added value in any area where communication with different entities
is required
- IoT market growing -> New open-source approach for future projects

# Recommendations for further work
- Expansion of device limit
- Universal applicability
- Security
- Wireless actuators & sensors
- Support multiple operating systems
